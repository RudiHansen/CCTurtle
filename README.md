# CCTurtle
Computercraft Turtle, used in minecraft for controlling a Turtle.
This is a work in progress, so use on your own risk, and please report any bugs you find.

# How to setup a new turtle.
Give the turtle a label with:
label set Miner1    (Miner1 is the label the turtle should have)

# Information a turtle should know.
Its Label
Its Position
Its Fuel level
Its Inventory level

# Plan
Make setup script for turtle to set Turtle label, and get Turtle position and save position to .dat file
Report status into to Computer

Make move function, for now thinking that its one function called with direction to move, and the method then updates turtles position and reports it to main computer.

# Next Step
List kept in the repository for the computer https://github.com/RudiHansen/CCComputer
