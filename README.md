# CCTurtle
Computercraft Turtle, used in minecraft for controlling a Turtle.

# Information a turtle should know.
Its Label
Its Position
Its Fuel level
Its Inventory level

# Plan
Make setup script for turtle to set Turtle label, and get Turtle position and save position to .dat file
Report status into to Computer

Make move function, for now thinking that its one function called with direction to move, and the method then updates turtles position and reports it to main computer.

# Next Step
Work on block avoidance.
Inside move.moveToPos and move.traverseArea the BYPASS section needs to work better.
